## Prerequisites

### Seil

Seil is an utility to map your Capslock key to another key.

Download it from [here](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en)

### Karabiner

Karabiner is a keyboard customizer for OS X, I use it to assign ctrl+alt+command+shift to the Caps Lock key and then use that "master" key in Slate.

Download it from [here](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en)

### Slate

Slate is a Window Manager application for OS X. Before I switched from Linux to Mac, I was using [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) and I needed more or less the same power and flexibility. I am quite happy with Slate, for the moment :)
